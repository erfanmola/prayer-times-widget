## Embed it on your own site

Paste this where you want the widget to appear. It is free, needs no API key, and works on any
page that allows iframes:

```html
<iframe src="https://qiblafind.net/embed/prayer-times" title="Prayer times" width="100%" height="670" style="border:0;max-width:100%" loading="lazy" allow="geolocation"></iframe>
<p style="font-size:13px"><a href="https://qiblafind.net/prayer-times">Prayer times</a> by QiblaFind</p>
```

The full version of this tool is at **[QiblaFind](https://qiblafind.net/prayer-times)**.

## How this repository works

This is a small static site with no dependencies:

- `src/index.html` holds the page, with `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` that are filled at build time.
- `scripts/build.mjs` renders it into `dist/`, along with `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`,
  and rebuilds monthly so date-based text stays current.

The site URL comes from GitHub Pages itself, so a fork or a copy under another account deploys
correctly without edits:

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Open **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main`, or run the workflow manually.

To build locally, run `node scripts/build.mjs` (Node 18 or newer). The output goes to `dist/`.

Optional repository variables:

- `EMBED_ORIGIN` loads the widget from another deployment.
- `LINK_ORIGIN` changes where the tool links point.

Both default to `https://qiblafind.net`.
